    <div class="ingredient_desc_ex">
        <p>There are 2 primary categories of grains used to brew beer. These grains are processed through a procedure called malting that allows the grain to sprout whicn in turn expose essential starches and enzymes that will be broken down into fermentable and unfermentable sugars during the mashing process of brewing. Once the grains begin the sprout they are immediately kilned to halt any further growth, at which point the grain can also be called a malt. See the image from Northern Brewer's website to the right to know what malted grains look like. </p>

    <div class="ingredient_desc_ex">
        <p>If grain provides the flavor of the beer then hops provide the essence. Hops are added throughout the boilinng phase of the brewing process for adding a bitter flavor and unique aroma to the beer. The flavor and aroma added to the beer is dependent on the hop variety. There are literally hundreds of different hop varietals. Each hop is specifically bred to be bittering, aroma or both. Some of the familiar flavors and aromas you may detect in beer are grapefruit, pine, citrus, and tropical fruits just to name few. The main component of the hop that determines its characteristics is Lupulin. The amount of bittering capability of a hop is measured by its alpha acid level. Hops with higher alpha acid content are usually called bittering hops. In a creative sense it's up to the brewer what hops they use and what flavor they're goinng for in their beer. Hops can come packaged in either leaf, pellet or essential oil form. See the image from Northern Brewer's website to the right to know what hop pellets look like.</p>

    <div class="ingredient_desc_ex"><h2>Hop Categories</h2>
        <b>1. Aroma</b>
            <div class="ingredient_notes">
                Aroma hops are used primarily for exactly that - adding aroma to beer. However, it should be noted that there's nothing saying you can't use them interchangeably for bittering.

                This is an aroma type hop, which usually comes in the 4-7% alpha acid range. Some of the notable flavors and aromas this hop imparts are pine and grapefruit. 
            </div>
        <b>2. Citra</b>
            <div class="ingredient_notes">
                This hop is considered an aroma hop as well even though it has higher alpha acid content. Brewers use this in their beer if they're going for a citrusy, melon, tropical fruit like flavor and aroma.

    <div class="ingredient_desc_ex">
        <p>Yeast is what makes the beer. The sweet sugar water that is collected at the end boiling part of the brewing process is called wort. That wort is transformed into beer
        by the yeast. Once considered to be a magical power in antiquity we now know that these single-celled organism break the complex fermentable sugars in the wort down, then leave
        Carbon Dioxide and alcohol behind as by products. There are 2 primary types of yeast - ale and lager. However, yeast develop certain characteristics in different parts of the
        world which cause them to produce different flavors, an example of this is the Hefewiezen yeast from Germany. This yeast produces the well known banana (ester) and clove (phenolic) 
        flavors in this well known style of beer. On that note there are many styles of beer from around the world and the different kinds of yeast play a huge roll in making those beers. See the image from Wyeast's website to the right to know what packaged liquid yeast looks like.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ingredient_desc_ex"><h2>Yeast Categories</h2>
        <b>1. Ale Yeast</b>
            <div class="ingredient_notes">
                Ale yeast is a top-croppimng/fermenting type of yeast with a species name saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is obviously used in making ale type beers and does not require
                the amount of time or low temperatures to produce beer that lager yeast do. Ale yeast tend to produce a sweeter more full bodied beer.
            </div>
        <b>2. Lager Yeast</b>
            <div class="ingredient_notes">
                This type of yeast is a bottom-cropping/fermenting type of yeast with species name of saccharomyces pastorianus. Lager yeast are used in the production of many popular 
                beers around the world. It is best known for having a cleaner and lighter finish which usually makes lager beers more refreshing.
            </div>
    </div>

    <div class="ingredient_desc_ex"><h2>Examples of Yeast Strains</h2>
        <b>1. American Wheat Ale </b>
            <div class="ingredient_notes">
                Per the wyeast website: A strong fermenting, true top cropping yeast that produces a dry, slightly tart, crisp beer. Ideal for beers where low ester profile is desirable.
            </div>
        <b>2. English Special Bitter</b>
            <div class="ingredient_notes">
                Per the wyeast website: A great yeast for malt-predominate ales. Produces light fruit and ethanol aromas along with soft, nutty flavors. Exhibits a mild malt profile with a neutral finish. Bright beers are easily achieved without any filtration. It is similar to our 1968 London ESB Ale but slightly less flocculent.

<div class="ingredients"><h1><a id="water">Water</a></h1>
    <div class="ingredient_desc_ex">
        <p>Last but not least, water is an essential part of beer. H2O plays a major roll in the flavor of beer. Like yeast many beers from around the world are well known because of the characteristics of the local water source from which they are made. While a thorough discussion of water chemistry in beer is way beyond the scope of this document, some of the elements of water brewers pay attention too are hardness and mineral content. One example of a famous water style that is from Burton-on-Trent in England. Brewers around the world Burtonize (match the local H2O source minerality and hardness to that of Burton) in an attempt to copy the famous beers of Burton. One local brewery here in St. Louis, Civil Life Brewing Company, makes their own version of a Burton style beer called Burton-on-Holt.</p>
